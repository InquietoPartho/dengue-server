## 🧠 Project Overview

The **Dengue Diagnosis Predictor** is an intelligent web-based application built with **Streamlit** that leverages a **Stacking Classifier** ensemble machine learning model to estimate the likelihood of dengue infection using hematological and demographic parameters.

This tool empowers medical practitioners and health professionals with a decision support system that not only predicts dengue status but also explains the reasoning using **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations) visualizations.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔮 **AI-powered Prediction** of Dengue status (Positive/Negative)
- 📊 **Interactive Input Interface** for over 18 patient health indicators
- 🧾 **SHAP Force Plot** to visualize feature contribution for transparency
- 🧠 **Top 5 Influential Features** highlighted for clinical insight
- ⚡ Real-time performance using a pre-trained stacking ensemble model
