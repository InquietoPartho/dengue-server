## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The **Dengue Diagnosis Predictor** is an intelligent web-based application built with **Streamlit** that leverages a **Stacking Classifier** ensemble machine learning model to estimate the likelihood of dengue infection using hematological and demographic parameters.

This tool empowers medical practitioners and health professionals with a decision support system that not only predicts dengue status but also explains the reasoning using **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations) visualizations.

## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸ”® **AI-powered Prediction** of Dengue status (Positive/Negative)
- ðŸ“Š **Interactive Input Interface** for over 18 patient health indicators
- ðŸ§¾ **SHAP Force Plot** to visualize feature contribution for transparency
- ðŸ§  **Top 5 Influential Features** highlighted for clinical insight
- âš¡ Real-time performance using a pre-trained stacking ensemble model
